            <h3 style="text-align:center;"><i>SUPERNOVA</i></h3>
            <pstyle="text-align:center;">A supernova is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen. It is a colossal explosion of a star. Each blast is extremely bright and super-powerful. As these stars burn the fuel in their cores, they produce heat. This heat produces pressure that pushes outward against the forces of gravity that pull inward on the star. For most of the life of a star, inward gravity and outward pressure are in balance and the star is stable. But as a star burns through its fuel and begins to cool, the outward forces of pressure drop. When the pressure drops low enough in a massive star, gravity suddenly takes over and the star collapses in just seconds. This collapse produces the explosion we call a <b>supernova</b>. Supernovae are considered one of the original sources of the elements heavier than iron in the Universe. Even the iron in your blood can be traced back to supernovae or similar cosmic explosions from long before our Sun had formed! Imagine something one million times the mass of Earth collapsing in 15 seconds!</p>

                <h4>Some Intriguing facts about Supernovas</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li> A supernova occurs somewhere in the universe every 10 seconds.</li>
                  <li>Supernovae are sources in our universe of elements, radiation, and neutrinos.</li>
                  <li>Supernovae are cosmic particle accelerators that can be replicated in a laboratory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most recently discovered supernova in the Milky Way is <b>Kepler's Supernova</b>.In 1604, a new star appeared in the night sky that was much brighter than Jupiter and dimmed over several weeks. This event was witnessed by sky watchers including the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler. Centuries later, the debris from this exploded star is known as the Kepler supernova remnant. Just look at this beauty!</p>

            <h3 style="color:blue";><i>NEBULA</i></h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>Nebulae exist in the space between the stars—also known as interstellar space. A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion caused by a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form. For this reason, some nebulae are called "star nurseries".</p>
            <h4><b>How do stars form in a nebula?</b></h4>
            <p>Nebulae are made of dust and gases—mostly hydrogen and helium. The dust and gases in a nebula are very spread out, but gravity can slowly begin to pull together clumps of dust and gas. As these clumps get bigger and bigger, their gravity gets stronger and stronger.Eventually, the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses from its own gravity. The collapse causes the material at the center of the cloud to heat up-and this hot core is the beginning of a star.
            </p>
            <p>The closest known nebula to Earth is called the <b>Helix Nebula</b>. It is the remnant of a dying star—possibly one like the Sun. It is approximately 700 light-years away from Earth. That means even if you could travel at the speed of light, it would still take you 700 years to get there!</p>

            <h4 style="color:blue;"><b>Orion Nebula</b></h4>
            <p >The Orion Nebula, also known as Messier 42 (or M42 for short),  is the nearest star-forming region to Earth, located approximately 1,350 light-years away and is about 2 million years old. The billowing clouds of gas and dust are located in the Orion Constellation, just below Orion's Belt. According to NASA, the majestic nebula can even be seen with the naked eye. It's also my favourite Nebula!<br>The bustling stellar nursery is brimming with towering pillars of gas and dust that are home to fledgling stars. The entire scene is sculpted by stellar winds ejected by young stars that also emit powerful ultraviolet light. In 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope captured the sharpest view of the Orion Nebula ever seen,  a stunning image revealing more than 3000 stars!</p>
